# Summary

- What
  
  - They introduce a new framework for LM reasoning and acting which can interact with APIs, called ReAct.
  - They apply this approach to several benchmarks and obtain new SoTA results.
  - They show that ReAct is more interpretable than previous methods used to solve the same tasks, since it generates reasoning traces.
